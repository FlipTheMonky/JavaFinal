Patrick - Need to add and format

Zach & Wakako: Formatted questions, created repository, added files
Question.java - Created by Zach

Idea: The way Zach and Wakako formatted the questions, we were thinking of creating a GUI with radio buttons for each answer. We will be 
storing the answers in an array. Before each answer in the text document, we have the index of the array with the correct answer.
